        <p>
            griddle is a simple game where you find a word by picking one letter from each row of the grid.
        </p>

        <p>
            when you have made a valid word your score will be displayed.
        </p>

        <p>
            there are two ways to play the game, either aiming for the highest possible score, or the lowest possible score.
        </p>

        <p>
            the score is calculated based on how many other valid words start with the same letters as the word you selected.
        </p>

        <p>
            for example for the 4x4 grid <br>
            <pre>
fmrt
atui
ntls
tpek
            </pre>

        </p>

        <p>
            there are 53 possible words, the highest possible score is 35 and the lowest possible score is 11.
        </p>

        <p>
            the highest scoring word is <strong>mine</strong> as there are 22 valid words that start with <strong>m</strong>, 9 valid words that start with <strong>mi</strong>, 3 valid words that start with <strong>min</strong>, and one valid word that starts with <strong>mint</strong>
        </p>

        <p>22 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 35</p>


        <p>
            the lowest scoring word is <strong>fate</strong> as there are 7 valid words that start with <strong>f</strong>, 2 valid words that start with <strong>fa</strong>, 1 valid word that starts with <strong>fat</strong>, and one valid word that starts with <strong>fate</strong>
        </p>

        <p>7 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11</p>

        <p>it is possible for there to be multiple words that match the highest and lowest scores</p>
